### Reine'S Book Store

This is an Application to help Book Store Managers and Clients purchase their books stress free.

Once the application starts and you are at the home page, as a Manager, you can register new books that you have purchased.
As a client, you can get the list of available books in the store for purchase. You can also select those that you want.

MySQL has been used as a database to store data. SpringData JPA is the main framework that helps simplify and reduce boilerplate code.
